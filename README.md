# 💬 RizzApp

RizzApp is a web-based chatbot experience that uses the **Google Gemini API** to evaluate and interact with users based on their "Rizz" — a playful metric of charisma and charm.

The app responds to the user's messages with personality, dynamically updating a "Rizz Meter" to reflect how smooth, funny, confident, or flirty the conversation is. Customize the AI's personality in real-time to be:
- ✨ **Friendly**
- 🔥 **Flirty**
- 😂 **Funny**
- 💪 **Confident**
- 💪 **Authoritative**
